# README

What you have to do to write your code in mammal.
Mammal is pretty much python for crazy mathematicians who want to
compile and (auto-) optimize their code.

### What is this repository for?

* Define the features, and hopefully write a compiler
* Version: Aardvark

### How do I get set up?

* Just clone this stuff
* Configuration doesn't exist yet
* Dependencies: gcc will probably be needed
* Database configuration doesn't exist yet
* How to run tests: unknown so far
* Deployment instructions don't exist yet

### Contribution guidelines

* Writing tests is good
* Writing and proving theorems is better
* Code review is always a good idea
* Versions are named after different mammals

### Who do I talk to?

* Repo owner or admin
* nobody else knows anything
