Installation
============

Installing mammal is easy. Just follow the instructions for your
operating system.

Windows
-------

Go to [â˜ž http://conepictures.de/mammal] and download the installer for windows.
Once downloaded run ``mammal_aardvark_0.1_win.exe``, which will lead you
through the installation procedure. Unless you are using a terminal emulator,
installing the mammal-terminal is a good idea.

MacOS
-----

Here you have two options.
If you have *homebrew* installed, just install mammal via
ðŸ–¥ ``brew install mammal``.

**Note:** This will by default install ``mammal`` and
the *Mammal Package manager*, but not the *GUI components*.
You can have a look at the results of ðŸ–¥ ``brew options <program_package>``
to see available options ðŸ–¥ ::
    --minimal            Only install barest necessities.
    --with-gui           Install the GUI components.
    --no-packagemanager  Do not install the mammal package manager.
    --full               Install everything available.

You can also go to [â˜ž http://conepictures.de/mammal] and download the
``mammal_aardvark_0.1_mac.dmg`` and install that.
It will ask you which components to install.

Linux
-----

Use your installed package manager, e.g. *apt* or *Ubuntu Software*.
You can decide whether to not use the *Mammal Package Manager*,
and instead just use the package manager although you might miss out
on some of the versioning support.
