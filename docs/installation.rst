Installation
============

Installing mammal is easy. Just follow the instructions for your
operating system.

Windows
-------

Go to [http://conepictures.de/mammal] and download the installer for windows.
Once downloaded run ``mammal_aardvark_0.1_win.exe``, which will lead you
through the installation procedure. Unless you use a terminal emulator
installing the mammal-terminal is a good idea.

MacOS
-----

Here you have two options.
If you have *homebrew* installed, just install mammal via
``brew install mammal``.

**Note:** This will by default install ``mammal`` and
``mammal-packages``, but not the gui-components.
You can have a look at the results of ``brew options <program_package>``
to see available options:
``
    --minimal                 Only install barest necessities.
    --with-gui                Install the gui-components.
    --without-packagemanager  Do not install mammal-packages.
    --full                    Install everything available.
``

You can also go to [http://conepictures.de/mammal] and download the
``mammal_aardvark_0.1_mac.dmg`` and install that.

Linux
-----

Use your installed package manager, e.g. *apt* or *Ubuntu Software*.
You can decide whether to not use *mammal-packages*,
and instead just use the package manager.
