... is a functional programming language originally designed for mathematics
and other scientific computing. The basic concept idea is a python-like
language, which does not have mutability and is more flexible with regard to

from the command line or files. As runtime-environment either the
JVM (device independent) or the CPU/GPU itself (fast) can be used.
